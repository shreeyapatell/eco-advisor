# Blackwings Hackathon 2022 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Synopsis
Eco Advisor is a socio-environmental technological development used to provide keys insights into how users can reduce their carbon footprint by using Citibikes and recycling/compoosting. Users also have the ability to check the air quality of their locations. This data is ideally called through APIs (https://rapidapi.com/eskerda/api/citybikes/ and https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/air-quality/). We used a combination of digital tools and software including Figma, React, css, jsx, axios, and APIs to construct this app. 

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
